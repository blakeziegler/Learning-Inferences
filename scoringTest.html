It certainly helped that the empire had control over the three major gold fields to the south of them. As such, Ghana was referred to by traders as \"the Land of Gold,\" and the kings of Ghana were sometimes called \"the Lords of the Gold.\" As a result, the empire flourished. The king of Ghana had a monopoly on all gold nuggets that were found in the mines. The people were allowed to trade in gold dust, but had to turn over any gold nuggets to the government. As such, the state became very powerful as well, adding to the complexity of Ghana&apos;s agrarian civilization.";
